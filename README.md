Intelligent Business Idea / Grow Business Validator - Frontend

What this is
- A modern, responsive single-page frontend template for a SaaS landing page.
- Built with Bootstrap 5, jQuery, AOS (scroll animations), Chart.js (charts), and CountUp.js (counters).

Files
- index.html — The main page with Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, Footer and a feature modal.
- assets/css/styles.css — Theme, gradients, and custom styles.
- assets/js/main.js — Interactivity: smooth scroll, pricing toggle, counters, modals, small charts.

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required). For local dev with live reload use any static server.

Notes & Next steps
- The validation chart is demo-only; you can wire it to real API results.
- Add images and replace placeholder text and contact links with your real content.
- For production, consider bundling and minifying assets and pinning library versions in package.json.
